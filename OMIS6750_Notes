Chapter 1

Project Management fundaments are universial.
Can be adapted to creat new services, organize events,refurbish aging operations, and so fotrh.
It is esttimated that each person is likely to experience three to four career changes, 
managing projects is a talent worthy of development.

What is a project:
A project is a tempoary endeavor indertaken to create a unique product, service, or result.

The major characteristics of a project ae as follow:
An established objective
A defined life span with a beginning and an end.
The invoment of everal departments and professionals.
Doing something that has never benn done before.(typically)
Specific time, cost, and performance requirement.


What a Project Not?
projects should not be confused woth everyday work. It is NOT routine, repetitive work.

Program VS Project
A program is a group of related projects designed to accomplish a common goal over an extened period of time.
Each project within a program has a project manager. The major diff is in SCALE and TIME SPAN.

Project management is the process of managing a group of ongoing, interdependent, related projects in a coordinated way to achieve strategic objectives.
Each project retains its own goals and scope, the project manager and team are also motivated by the higher program goal.
Program goals are closely related to board strategic organization goals.

***Project life cycle

Defining stage - Goals, specifications, tasks, responsibility
Specifications of the o\project ae defined, project objectives are established, teams are formed, majr responsibility are assigned.

Planning stage - Schedules, budgets, resources, risks, staffing
The level of effort increases.and plans are developed to determine what the project will entail, when it will be scheduled, whom it will be benifited,
what quality level shuld be maintainedand the budget will be.

Executing stage - Status report, changes, quality, forecasts
A mojor portion of the project work take place.
Physical - bridge, report, software program   AND mental. Physical product is produces.
Time, Cost, and specification measures are used for control.

Closong stage - Train customer, transfer doc, release resources, evaluation, lessons learned
Delivering the project product to the customer, redeploying product resources and conducting a post-project review.


The project manager
Plan, schedule, motivated, and control.
Unique: They manage tempoly, nonrepetitive activities to complete a fixed-life project.
Must work with a diverse troupe of characters to complete projects.
The direct link to customer and must arrange the tension between customer expactions and what is feasible and resonable.
Provide direction, coordination and interation to the project team, made up of part-time participations loyal to their functional department.
Work with a cader of outsiders- vendors, suppliers, and subcontractors

They are ultimately reponsed for performance. Ensure approriate trade-offs are made among the time, cost, and performance requirements of the project.
Often possess only rudimentary technical knowledge to make such decision.
Must orchestrate the completion of the project by including the right people, at the right time, to address the right issues and make the right decision.

Agile Project management(Agile PM)
Emerged out of fustration with using traditional project management processes to develop software
Employs an incremental, iterative process sometimes reffered to as "rollin wave", approach to complete projects.
The final project design/outcomes is not known in great detail and is continously developed through a series of incremental iterations(waves)
Iterations typically last from one to four weeks.
Goal of each iteration is to make tangible process such as define a key requirement.

Focus onactive collab between the project team and customer reprentatives, breaking projects into small functional peices and adapting to changing requirements.
Agile works best in small teams of 4 to 8.

***CURENT DRIVES of PM

Compression of the Product Life Cycle
Shortening of the product life cycle. Time-to-market for new products become increasingly important.
Reley on cross-functional project team

Knowledge explosion
PM had emerged as the key displine for achieving this task.

Triple Bottom Line(Planet, People, Profit)
Sustainability

Increase customer focus

Small projects represent big problem

***PM Today: A socio-Technical Approach
Socioculture - 
Leadership, Problem solving, Teamwork, Negotation,Poltics, Customer expectations

Technical - 
Scope,WBS, schedules, Resourec allocation, Baseline budgets, Status reports.


Summary:
A project is defined as a nonroutine, one-time effort limited by time, resources, and performance specifications designed to meet customer needs. 
One of the distinguishing chara is that it has both beginning and ending and typically consists of 4 phases"
defining, planning, excuting, and closing.
Require both social and technical skills.
PM have to plan and budget projects as wella orchestrate th contributions of others.
